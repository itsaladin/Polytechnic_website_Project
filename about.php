    <p>In early 1955, Ford Foundation established Jhenaidah Polytechnic Institute, with a duration of 3 years long courses, based on the syllabus of Oklahoma State University, Still Water, USA. The certificate issued by the then Technical Board Education was “Associated in Engineering” having provision to undergo B.S course in USA and also in U.K. Its formation and academic course history details goes back to the birth of Ahsanullah Engineering College, which is now known as BUET.</p>

    <h2>Comparison and opportunity</h2>
    <p>After completing SSC level (10th grade, also known as ‘O’ level, SSC Vocational or ‘Dakhil’ level) a student can pursue his or her educational career for obtaining a “Diploma-in-Engineering” diploma degree which falls in “Technical Education System” from Polytechnic Institutes, or they can obtain HSC (12th grade, also known as ‘A’ level, or ‘Intermediate’ level, or ‘Alim’ level) certificate degree, which falls in “General Education System”, from various other academic colleges, and HSC being the mainstream study line in South-Asian countries. HSC courses focus mainly on various Science, Arts, Commerce, Business, Law, Medical, in various areas, whereas Diploma-in-Engineering courses in Polytechnic Institutes focus mostly on Technology (Applied & Practical Science) areas.</p>
    <p>The “Diploma-in-Engineering” diploma degree level is rated higher than the HSC certificate degree level, and both are lesser than a formal Baccalaureate or BSc (Bachelor in Science) degree, and both are also the entry level for enrolling into any B.Sc Engineering degrees. Students when complete the Diploma-in-Engineering (4 years long curriculum) courses, they acquire educational level equivalent to grade XIV (14th grade),[1] and students who complete HSC level (exactly 2 years long curriculum), they acquire educational level equivalent to grade XII (12th grade). Most of the diploma-in-engineering curriculum were extended from a 3 years study period to a 4 years long study period. In “Madrasah Education System”, the 14th grade is also known as ‘Fazil’ level.</p>

    <p>“Diploma-in-Engineering”, a diploma degree should not to be confused with a European, American “Diploma”, which usually has only 1 year or less long educational curriculum for obtaining a (Diploma) “certificate”, not a Degree. In those geographical areas, various Science & other Academic & Technical field subjects are offered for obtaining an “Associate” degree which includes a minimum of 2 years long curriculum, and also transferable toward obtaining a Bachelor degree, comes closest to a South-Asian “Diploma-in-Engineering” degree, where such “Associate” degree is still 2 years less than a South-Asian degree. Even though there are few other type of “Associate” degrees (1 yr, or, 2 yr) are offered in some Occupational or Vocational or various Trade Training areas, but since those are (usually) nontransferable,[2] so such “Associate” degrees are also much lesser than and not equivalent to a South-Asian “Diploma-in-Engineering” degree.</p>
    <p>After completing Diploma-in-Engineering from Polytechnic Institutes or HSC from other colleges (in South-Asian countries), students from both side can further pursue their educational carrier for obtaining a formal Engineering, Medical, Education, Business or Commerce etc., Bachelor degree in one of the following two categories, “Pass” (3 years) or “Honours” (Hons) (4 years) category, from various Public or Private Universities. Diploma Engineers can also enroll in Technology Universities for obtaining the BSc (Tech.Edn) or BSc.Eng (Engineering) degree, which includes 2 and a half years to 3 years long shorter curriculum, because students have already completed various required subjects in Diploma-in-Engineering level during their 4 years long courses, then after completing this BSc level, students reach at grade XVI (16th grade). Diploma students, if wants to, can also enroll in any other Public or Private Universities. Likewise, when HSC degree holders complete a formal Bachelor(Hons), BSc.Eng (Engineering), BSc.Agr (Agriculture), BSc.Text (Textile), BSc.Leat (Leather) or LLB(Hons), etc., then they reach at the Grade XVI (16th grade) level, which have at least 4 years long curriculum. Many HSC degree holders decides to obtain a formal BSc or Bachelor degree with “Pass” only, in available various subject areas, which are actually 3 years long courses (15th grade). In “Madrasah Education System”, the 16th grade is also known as ‘Kamil’ level.</p>
